# Security Policy

This Security Policy outlines the measures taken to ensure the security and integrity of the software licensed under the GNU Affero General Public License (AGPL) version 3.0. The goal of this policy is to create a safe and trustworthy environment for users and contributors of the software.

## Reporting Security Issues

If you discover a security vulnerability or have concerns regarding the security of the software, please follow these steps to report it:

1. **Alert the Maintainers**: Contact the project maintainers immediately by sending an email to [maintainers-email-address]. Please provide detailed information about the vulnerability or concern and include steps to reproduce, if applicable.

2. **Encrypted Communication**: If you have sensitive information to share, such as details of an ongoing security incident, you can use the project's encrypted communication channel, if available. Reach out to the maintainers for further instructions.

3. **Responsible Disclosure**: Give the maintainers a reasonable amount of time to address the reported vulnerability or concern before disclosing it publicly. The maintainers will work diligently to investigate and resolve the issue promptly.

## Handling of Security Reports

Upon receiving a security report, the project maintainers will follow these procedures:

1. **Acknowledgment**: The maintainers will acknowledge the receipt of the security report within a reasonable timeframe.

2. **Investigation**: The maintainers will conduct an initial investigation of the reported issue to validate its legitimacy and determine its severity.

3. **Mitigation**: If the reported vulnerability or concern is verified, the maintainers will work diligently to develop and implement an appropriate mitigation strategy. This may involve developing patches, updates, or configuration changes.

4. **Disclosure**: Once the vulnerability is addressed, the maintainers will collaborate with the reporting individual or organization to determine an appropriate disclosure plan. The maintainers may also request the reporting party to refrain from publicly disclosing the issue until a coordinated release is possible.

5. **Public Announcement**: After the vulnerability is resolved and a coordinated disclosure plan is in place, the maintainers will release a security advisory to inform the user community about the issue, its impact, and the available updates or patches.

6. **Attribution**: The maintainers are committed to giving credit to individuals or organizations that responsibly report security vulnerabilities. If desired, the reporting party will be acknowledged in the security advisory, unless they explicitly request otherwise.

## User Responsibilities

To maintain the security and integrity of the software, users are expected to:

1. **Stay Up-to-Date**: Regularly update to the latest version of the software and apply any available security patches or updates provided by the project maintainers.

2. **Secure Configuration**: Follow the recommended security guidelines provided by the project to ensure the software is configured securely and robustly.

3. **Responsible Use**: Use the software responsibly and refrain from engaging in activities that may compromise the security or privacy of others.

## Scope

This security policy applies to the software distributed under the GNU Affero General Public License (AGPL) version 3.0. It encompasses the core codebase, official releases, and any associated components, libraries, or plugins maintained by the project.

## Disclaimer

While the project maintainers strive to promptly address security vulnerabilities and concerns, they cannot guarantee that the software will be entirely free from security issues. Users and contributors are advised to exercise caution and implement additional security measures where necessary.

## Contact Information

To report a security vulnerability or for any security-related inquiries, please contact the project maintainers at [maintainers-email-address].

Please note that this Security Policy is subject to change and may be updated or modified as necessary.
